  -------------------------------

Life includes both random events and rule based events.
If we have enough data about past events to find about
rules in them, by simulating random events and finding
optimized event pairs (based on found rules), we can
predict future.

Randife is a framework for predicting future with
random simulating. It includes some sub projects
which implement Randife for predicting specified
events, such as:
